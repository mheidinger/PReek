## Install

### Direct Download

A signed and notarized DMG installer can be found in the the [latest release](https://github.com/mheidinger/PReek/releases/latest).

### Brew

Brew installation is available through my personal homebrew tap:

```bash
brew install mheidinger/tap/preek
```

To make it possible for PReek to be available from the official tap, some [popularity is required](https://docs.brew.sh/Acceptable-Casks#rejected-casks). So feel free to ‚≠ê this repository!

### App Store - Maybe Coming Soon

Depending on the success of the project I'll decide whether it is worth the effort to publish to the App Store or not.

## FAQ

### Why is the `notification` scope required for the GitHub PAT?

PReek shows Pull Requests for which you got notifications for.
To be able to fetch your notifications, the `notifications` scope is required.

### Why is a given Pull Request not shown?

As PReek shows Pull Requests for which you got notifications for, please check whether you received a notification for the missing Pull Request in the [Notifications Inbox](https://github.com/notifications).
If you did not get a notification, verify that you have not disabled them for a given repository.
See the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications) for more information.

Additionally check if the repository it private / internal and if yes, whether you granted the `repo` scope to the GitHub PAT.
This scope is required to be able to access private repositories.

### Why is no team name shown if a review has been requested by a team?

An additional PAT scope `read:org` is required to access the name of a team.

### Are there any keyboard shortcuts?

There are basic VIM-like motions build in:

| Key | Action |
| --- | ------ |
| j | Move down |
| k | Move up |
| g | Jump to top |
| G | Jump to bottom |
| \<Space\> | Open / Close focused PR |
